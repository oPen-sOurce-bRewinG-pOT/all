This code generates fake data for (default) 100 objects (quasars) for a period of
one year with data on each day, for R and J bands. Go to /src/ and then make the
necessary changes to generator.c (which includes changing N_THR for a machine
with more threads than 2, tnum for number of objects and N for number of days.


As a random number generator, Dynamic Creator Mersenne Twister of period 2^521
is used, which is thread-safe and fast. Refer to DCMT README for editing DCMT
related parts.

To include more bands, you need to incorporate those bands into the obj structure
defined in the generator.c file, as well as defining the required min, max and
width of the frequency range into the param.h file, and adding the requisite 
generator in functions.h.

This code utilizes 8-point Gauss Quadrature method for integrations. You can
modify the requisite u[8] and w[8] arrays to incorporate higher quadrature
methods.

Use 'make' to make the requisite libraries and binaries. Then execute ./generator
to run the code.
