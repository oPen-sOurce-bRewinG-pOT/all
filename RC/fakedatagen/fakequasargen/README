This code generates fake data for a maximum of 100 objects (quasars) for a 
period of one year with data on each day, for R and J bands. The code is
multithreaded via OpenMP, so GCC compiler is recommended. The code compiles
on CLang, however, though it executes on only one thread.

Four kinds of sampling options are available:
1. SDSS - SDSS Quasar based sampling, around 78 data points in 6 years.
2. HB - Around 81 data points in 9 years.
3. Good - Around 180 data points in less than 2 years.
4. Raw - Data for every day for as long as you want.


As a random number generator, Dynamic Creator Mersenne Twister of period 2^521
is used, which is thread-safe and fast. Refer to DCMT README for editing DCMT
related parts.

To include more bands, you need to incorporate those bands into the obj structure
defined in the generator.c file, as well as defining the required min, max and
width of the frequency range into the param.h file, and adding the requisite 
generator in functions.h.

This code utilizes 8-point Gauss Quadrature method for integrations. You can
modify the requisite u[8] and w[8] arrays to incorporate higher quadrature
methods.

Use 'make' to make the requisite libraries and binaries. Then execute ./generator
to run the code.
