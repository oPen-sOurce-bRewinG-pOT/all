Installation guide for XD and other codes (galpy, bovy_mcmc,flexgp, qso-var) of Jo Bovy:

1. Install EPD python. This is important. The existing Python in both Linux and Mac had some troubles. EPD installation files are saved in quasar (~/Desktop/Software_installed/Python_installers).

2. Install homebrew. This is similar to Macports, i.e., a software which makes downloading and installing other software easy.
Homebrew can be found here: http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/
The provide this command for installation:
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

But that does not work in tcsh. For non-bash shells use:
curl -sL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go | ruby

or type bash in terminal and then copy and paste the original command.

3. Use homebrew to install GNU Scientific Library (gsl):
brew install gsl --universal

This installs gsl at the right place where Bovy's codes will look for it. Unlike macport which nstalls gsl in /opt/local/include which Bovy's codes cannot find.

4. Mac already had git. I downloaded Bovy's codes by
git clone https://github.com/jobovy/galpy.git
git clone https://github.com/jobovy/bovy_mcmc.git
git clone https://github.com/jobovy/flexgp.git
git clone https://github.com/jobovy/qso-var.git

5. In all three directories other than qso-var, do
python setup.py install

This will work only if you have EPD python and gsl installed by homebrew. Otherwise one or the other step will give errors.

6. Now to install XD (the version with non-gaussian errors) use:
svn checkout http://extreme-deconvolution.googlecode.com/svn/branches/ngerrors extreme-deconvolution-read-only

There are other vesrions (mentioned in his google code website for XD) but those do not include non-gaussian errors.

7. When XD is downloaded, use the instructions in the INSTALL file to install XD.
commands are:
make
sudo make install
make pywrapper
make testpy
make clean

There are other options mentioned in the INSTALL file. You may use them if you need.

The above may also give errors if it's not EPD python.

8. These should do it. You may go ahead and test codes like 
import varqso 
v=varqso.VarQso('filename.fits') 
v.plot() 

or

xdplot or xdAGamma commands as mentioned in ~/git_rit/file_index_writeup.
