Pre-requisites: Fastest Fourier Transform in the West v 3, known better 
as FFTW.

Install with options:

CFLAGS=-fPIC --prefix=/usr/local --enable-sse2 --enable-threads 
--enable-shared --with-pic

Make sure you are using GCC, not CLang.

Check with gcc --version .
It should clearly state whether it is CLang or GCC.

If it is CLang, then do the following:

Install homebrew. Then execute the following:

$brew search gcc

(Without the $, of course)
Then You will find homebrew/dupes/apple-gcc42 as one of the options.
Next execute

$brew install homebrew/dupes/apple-gcc42

Make sure the binaries have been linked.

Finally, put the following line in your /etc/bashrc or ~/.bash_profile 
(Mac):

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH


Then save changes, and either open a new terminal window or source the 
rc file you changed to continue installing FFTW. Then you can execute 
the following, in order, to make this library:

make
sudo make install
make pywrapper


After this, you should be able to execute the following:

import gauss_rand_2d (in python)

k = gauss_rand_2d.gauss_rand_2d ( nx , ny , variance , power )

k will be returned as a numpy array ( nx , ny ) , double.

Happy coding!
