Pre-requisites: GSL Library

GSL Library can be installed in Mac OS X with Homebrew (recommended, MacPorts is not recommended): brew install gsl

In Linux, you can either build it manually (with --prefix=/usr/local). In Ubuntu you can install GSL with apt-get. Google for necessary info.

Make sure you are using GCC, not CLang.

Check with gcc --version .
It should clearly state whether it is CLang or GCC.

If it is CLang, then do the following:

Install homebrew. Then execute the following:

$brew search gcc

(Without the $, of course)
Then You will find homebrew/dupes/apple-gcc42 as one of the options.
Next execute

$brew install homebrew/dupes/apple-gcc42

Make sure the binaries have been linked.

Finally, put the following line in your /etc/bashrc or ~/.bash_profile 
(Mac):

export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH


Then save changes, and either open a new terminal window or source the 
rc file you changed to continue installing FFTW. Then you can execute 
the following, in order, to make this library:

make
sudo make install
make pywrapper

Run make testpy to make sure the code is giving the right results. It should return you
an array containing "True" only.


After this, you should be able to execute the following:

import d_hankel_t (in python)

k = d_hankel_t.compute_dht ( size (length of array) , input array , order of J , maximum range of x )

k will be returned as a numpy array ( size ) , double.

Happy coding!
