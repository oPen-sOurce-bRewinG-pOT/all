\textbf{ABSTRACT: }The motion of a lazy random walker is studied in one dimension. With a more physical definition of laziness, the diffusion of the walker is observed. The first return probability is also numerically calculated for the walker, for various laziness ``levels'', and a comparison is made for various laziness levels, including a normal random walker. A relation of the kind $\left \langle d^2 \right \rangle = a\times \left \langle t_{fr} \right \rangle ^b$ is established, with the value of the exponent exactly 3, for all laziness levels in the transient analysis of the first return probability for the random walker. It is also established that the first return probability in the transient region is always higher for higher value of laziness, for a given time limit to the random walker, and ultimately the probability converges (asymptotically) to 1.
